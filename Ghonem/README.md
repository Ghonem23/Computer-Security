# RC4 Encryption and Decryption

This project implements the RC4 stream cipher for encryption and decryption of text data. It includes functions for key scheduling, pseudorandom generation, and encryption/decryption using the RC4 algorithm. The project also includes test cases for validating the functionality.

## Project Structure

- `RC4_algorithm.py`: The main Python script containing the RC4 implementation.
- `input.txt`: The input file used for testing encryption and decryption.
- `output.txt`: The output file where the encrypted or decrypted data is stored.
